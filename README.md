## Walkthrough
1. the game starts by showing the users the board and asking p1 to type a number 1-9.
2. then the bord reapper and with the change for the number the player one had changed and it will be x or o.
3. player two will be able to choose a number from 1-9 minus the number that the first on choose.
4. the game goes on until one reaches 3 o in a row/colomn/diagonal or 3 x in a row/column/diagonal.
5. if they finshed the numbers with none of this done( one reaches 3 o in a row/column/diagonal or 3 x in a row/column/diagonal) the game will show the draw.
